# The Vision
As technology grows and what can be done online gets more and more advanced, we believe that many people struggle to not fall victim to hacks, whether it be from phishing emails or weak passwords. The goal of our project is to help people strengthen their cyber habits. To accomplish this we created a website that a few different ideas on how people can improve their habits online. 

# Methodology
TechNoHow was originally going to be a website that featured a password checker and examples of phishing emails. However, implementing the idea along with the APIs was more challenging than we initially thought. We settled on an Android app that partnered with a companion website. We then split up the work so we could get a foundation on the website and set up the basic views of the app. From there we spent a lot of time reading API documentation to enable the password strength tester and the email functionality. After understanding the API, we went back to splitting up the work between the App and the website, and enjoyed working on this project  most of the time.
